## 🔷 MASTER PROTOTYPE PROMPT FOR “A2S - AESTHETICS TO SPACES”

> Version: v0 | Platform Type: Real Estate + Room Design + AI Assistant
> Purpose: Generate a **clickable, premium-quality frontend prototype** that looks fully functional using **dummy data**, including smart search filters, AI-based flow, and interior customization.

---

## 🧠 OVERVIEW

Build a modern, premium, and visually rich prototype for **A2S - Aesthetics to Spaces**, a real estate and design platform offering:

1. **Property Search & Transactions** (Buy / Rent / Land)
2. **2.5D Room Customization Studio**
3. **AI Assistant Chat** for intelligent discovery and suggestions
4. **Consultant Booking**
5. **User Dashboard**

Each module must include intuitive UX, realistic dummy data, component interactivity (drag/drop, chat, sliders), and clear CTA buttons. The design should feel like a modern, enterprise-level product, with responsiveness and subtle animations.
